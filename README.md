# Scene bundles
![Tests](https://github.com/lotgd/module-scene-bundle/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

Adds a bunch of decorative scenes to existing villages. It is recommende to only use 
this module for demonstration reasons. It only adds a few predefined scenes, with
no special features whatsoever, and no new templates. Without at least 1 scene
that has the template `LotGD\Module\Village\SceneTemplates\VillageScene`, this
module is useless.

## Requirements
### Module
- lotgd/module-village
### Scene templates
- `LotGD\Module\Village\SceneTemplates\VillageScene`
Only for automatic installation.
